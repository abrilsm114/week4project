# week4project

This repository is my submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. Here, I'm listing the instructions on how to run analysis on this dataset.

Dataset Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations on the data.

In week4project.R, I prepared the data and then followed these steps as described in the course projectâ€™s definition: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
